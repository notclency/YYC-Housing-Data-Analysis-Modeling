# YYC-Housing-Data-Analysis-Modeling
This project explores housing data from Calgary to predict assessed property values. It applies feature engineering, preprocessing pipelines, and a machine learning model to improve predictive performance.  The main workflow is implemented in prod.py, which prepares derived features, applies a preprocessing pipeline, and generates predictions.
